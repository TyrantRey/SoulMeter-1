**A real-time DPS meter and combat overlay for [SoulWorker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377580/Soulworker/).**

Live damage tables, per-player breakdowns, buff uptime, DPS graphs and a combat log — drawn straight over the game.

## What it does

SoulMeter reads the game's network traffic and turns it into a live picture of your run — who is doing what damage, which buffs are up, when the boss died and why your numbers look the way they do.

| Feature | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Damage table** | Live DPS, total damage, share %, crit rate and hit counts for every player in your party |
| **Per-player detail** | Click a name to break a player down by skill — damage, casts, crit rate, average hit |
| **Buff tracking** | Uptime for armour break, attack speed, boss damage and more |
| **DPS graphs** | Damage-over-time plots per player, powered by ImPlot |
| **Combat log** | A recorded blow-by-blow of the encounter |
| **Skill timeline** | Every skill cast plotted per player against the raid clock as a zoomable Gantt chart with the damage each cast dealt, plus a filterable list and CSV export |
| **History** | The last 50 runs are kept and can be reopened and compared |
| **Ping** | Live latency, measured from the game's own heartbeat exchange |
| **Faster loading** | Cuts cold game startup from ~95s to ~38s — see [Load-time optimisations](#load-time-optimisations) |
| **QoL Keybinds** | Adds keybinds to restart/exit mazes quicker than in-game |
| **Localised** | English, 日本語, 한국어, 繁體中文 |

## Getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No external loader is needed.** Earlier releases required a separate injector — this one injects itself.

1. Grab a release (or [build it yourself](#building-from-source)).
2. Keep the folder layout intact:
   ```
   SoulMeter.exe
   SoulMeterHook.dll     <- capture DLL, injected into the game
   sqlite3.dll
   SWDB.db               <- skill / monster / map names
   Lang/                 <- en, jp, kr, zh_tw
   Font/                 <- optional, drop .ttf files here
   ```
3. **Run `SoulMeter.exe` as Administrator**, then launch the game.

The meter waits for the game process, injects automatically the moment it appears, and switches from *Waiting for SoulWorker* to your world name once packets start flowing.

### Hotkeys

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl` + `End` | Show / hide the overlay |
| `Ctrl` + `Del` | Reset the current run |

Both are rebindable in `option.xml` using [DirectInput key codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee418641(v=vs.85)).

### Tips

- **Right-click the title bar** for the full feature menu.
- **Left-click a character's row** to open their detailed breakdown.
- Non-Latin text not rendering? Drop a font covering your language into `Font/` and pick it in the Font Selector.
- User settings live in `option.xml` and `imgui.ini`; saved history in `SoulMeter.dat`.

## How it works

Capture happens **inside the game process** rather than on the wire, which means no packets are missed and no traffic is intercepted at the network layer.

```
SoulMeter.exe                              SoulWorker (game process)
├── Injector ──── injects ───────────────► SoulMeterHook.dll
│                                          └── detours the game's own
│                                              packet (de)serialisers
└── PipeReceiver ◄── \\.\pipe\SoulMeterHook ──┘  (complete, plaintext frames)
         │
         └──► SWPacketMaker → damage / buff / combat state → ImGui overlay
```

The hook attaches to the client's own serialiser and deserialiser rather than to `ws2_32`. That matters: the client is an IOCP application issuing overlapped `WSARecv`, so socket-level hooks never observe a single byte. Hooking the game's own functions also means the client has already reassembled the TCP stream and decrypted the packet body by the time we see it — so frames arrive complete, in order, and exactly once, with no reassembly on our side to fall out of sync.

**Built with** ImGui + ImPlot on DirectX 11 · SQLite for game data · FlatBuffers for history · MinHook for the detours · nlohmann/json for i18n · tinyxml2 for settings.

## Load-time optimisations

Since the hook is already inside the game process, it also removes the work that dominates a cold start — plus a delay paid on every zone change. Measured on a 511199 client, startup went from **~95s to ~38s**.

| What the client does | What the hook does | Saved |
|---|---|---|
| MD5-hashes `data01.v`–`data60.v` and `packinginfo.dat` — **9.2 GiB of file content** — on *every* launch | Memoises each hash against the file's size and last-write time | **~57s** |
| Reads archive file tables in ~194-byte chunks, seeking before nearly every one — 2.57M reads in ~5s, ~80% of it inside `ReadFile` | Serves those reads from 32 KB blocks in a 32 MB cache, collapsing ~2.5M syscalls to ~26k | **~3s** |
| Holds the zone loading screen for a hardcoded 0.5s *after* the map is already resident | Zeroes that one timer | 0.5s per warp |

The hash is **memoised, not skipped** — the value handed back is the one the client would have computed, so a local comparison or a server-side check sees no difference. Archives that change on patch day are rehashed automatically, so updates need no action.

Hashes are cached in `swmd5cache.txt` next to the game executable, or in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoulMeter\` when the install folder isn't writable (Steam, Program Files). Deleting it costs one slow launch, nothing more.

> [!NOTE]
> Each optimisation locates its target by signature and **fails closed** — if a game patch moves or changes the code, that optimisation quietly disables itself rather than acting on the wrong bytes, and the meter carries on as normal. All three were verified against GB 511199, GB 0820, KR and KR 2.4.27.0.

## Building from source

Requires **Visual Studio 2022** (v143 toolset, C++20).

```bash
MSBuild "Soulworker Utility.sln" -m -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64
```

Output lands in `x64\Release\`. The solution builds two projects — `Soulworker Utility` (the meter) and `SoulMeterHook` (the injected DLL) — and copies `Lang\*.json` into the output folder automatically.

A Release build also stages a ready-to-ship copy in `x64\Release\package\` and zips it as `x64\Release\SoulMeter-<version>.zip` (the version comes from `Soulworker Utility\SWConfig.h`). The zip holds the meter, the hook DLL, `sqlite3.dll`, `SWDB.db`, `Lang\` and `Font\`. Fonts are not tracked in git — drop the `.ttf` you want to ship into `Soulworker Utility\Font\` before building, otherwise the build warns and the package goes out without one.

> [!NOTE]
> The hook locates the game's packet functions at runtime by signature-scanning `SoulWorker64.dll`, so a game patch that merely moves them needs no changes here. The scan fails closed — if the signature is missing or matches more than once, the hook simply never attaches rather than detouring the wrong code. If that happens, `kSerializeSig` in `SoulMeterHook/sockethooks.cpp` needs re-extracting.
